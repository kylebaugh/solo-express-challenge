To run this project, first clone it to your device

Once cloned, install packages with `npm i`

If you have nodemon installed on your device, run `nodemon` to run the local instance of your server. If you don't have nodemon, run `node server/index.js` to start the server. 

I created a bare-bones front-end to have a visual interface for my endpoints. I like the Liver Server extension on VSCode. That will allow you to open the main index.html file in your browser. You can then test the endpoints from there. You'll be able to view the front-end results in the console of your dev tools.
